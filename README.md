## Features

### General Features of of the site

Each page of the site shares the following:

* Favicon
* Navbar
* Footer

site pages images

### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
